Description: In causal mediation analysis with multiple causally ordered mediators, a set of path-specific
  effects are identified under standard ignorability assumptions. This package implements an imputation
  approach to estimating these effects along with a set of bias formulas for conducting sensitivity analysis
  (Zhou and Yamamoto <doi:10.31235/osf.io/2rx6p>). It contains two main functions: paths() for estimating 
  path-specific effects and sens() for conducting sensitivity analysis. Estimation uncertainty is quantified 
  using the nonparametric bootstrap.
